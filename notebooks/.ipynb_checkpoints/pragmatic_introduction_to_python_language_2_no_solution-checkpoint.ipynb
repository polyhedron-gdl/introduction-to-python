    "The date system currently in use is based on the Gregorian calendar, first established in 1582 by Pope Gregory XIII. This calendar was designed to correct the errors introduced by the less accurate Julian calendar. In the Gregorian calendar, a normal year consists of 365 days. Because the actual length of a sidereal year (the time required for the Earth to revolve once about the Sun) is actually 365.2425 days, a \"leap year\" of 366 days is used once every four years to eliminate the error caused by three normal (but short) years. Any year that is evenly divisible by 4 is a leap year: for example, 1988, 1992, and 1996 are leap years.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there is still a small error that must be accounted for. To eliminate this error, the Gregorian calendar stipulates that a year that is evenly divisible by 100 (for example, 1900) is a leap year only if it is also evenly divisible by 400.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason, the following years **are not** leap years:\n",
    "\n",
    "*1700, 1800, 1900, 2100, 2200, 2300, 2500, 2600*\n",

    "This is because **they are evenly divisible by 100 but not by 400**.\n",

We can import this module to a python program by using the ‘import datetime’ statement at the beginning of the program. This module provides a lot of different methods to work with time. For example, we can use this module to print the current time, add days to the current time, add hours to the current time, add minutes to the current time etc. ‘datetime’ module can work with ‘naive’ and ‘aware’ kind of date time objects. ‘aware’ objects can hold additional information with the date time value like daylight saving information etc. As I have explained above, it doesn’t provide any method to check the validity of a date. We will use its constructor to create one ‘datetime’ object using the user provided values. If the constructor fails, it will throw one error. We will assume that the input values are not valid in that case.\n",
