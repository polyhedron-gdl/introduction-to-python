1 - First click on Raw
2 - Then, press ctrl+s to save it as .ipynb (Note that you'll have to manually type '.ipynb' after the file name to make this work, as files from GitHub are saved as text files as default.)
3 - Open jupyter notebook
4 - Go to location where you saved .ipynb file
5 - Open file, you will see the code

Hope this helps
